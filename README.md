# Tennis Data Analysis (Databricks Lakehouse)

## Overview
This repository contains exploratory and analytical work focused on professional tennis data.  
The goal of this project is to create data engineering and analytics workflows using modern lakehouse patterns in Databricks. Publicly available tennis data is ingested and prepared to support downstream match- and point-level analysis.

At this stage, the repository is intentionally generic and serves as a foundation for deeper tennis analytics.
